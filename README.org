#+TITLE: Hunting-Mode
* THIS IS A WIP
If what you're looking at here looks interesting to you hit me up here or on Twitter @  @noonker_

* Overview
The problem with working with DFIR/Infrastructure Analysis/Threat hunting types of workflows is the different ways of visualizing the data and the need for both structured data but also not-cumbersome workflows. In all things there's a give and take.

So ideally I want:
 - Freeform notes that have an understanding of IoCs
 - The IoCs should be automatically enriched with configured datasets (is this IoC in VT? If so show some glyph next to it to let me know)
 - A way to pull in external APIs intelligence into my notes and maintain that linkage
 - Automatically maintain the time metadata of an IoC (first seen, last seen, update dates, and changes)
 - Maintain seperate investigations but be able to link the IoCs between investigations
 - Exportable in sharable formats (csv, stix/taxii)
 - Exportable in a roughly human readable form
 - Be able to visualize the IoCs as both a series of relationships between nodes and a timeseries graph and be able to filter on the graph

I think using org-roam with some enhanced features focused on IoCs and Pivoting will give me a lot of this.

* Installing
Many of these modules rely on interacting with a Python shell (with plans to migrate off this later)

Required Python Libraries
#+begin_src bash
pip3 install requests pyattck
#+end_src

Add the following to your .profile/.bashrc
#+begin_src bash
export HUNTING_BASE="/Users/person/git/hunting-mode"
export PATH="$HUNTING_BASE/bin:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="$HUNTING_BASE/src/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
#+end_src

And the following API keys if you have them / want to use the APIs
#+begin_src bash
# Alienvault
export ALIENVAULT_KEY=""

# Censys
export CENSYS_UID=""
export CENSYS_SECRET=""

# Domaintools
export DOMAINTOOLS_USER=""
export DOMAINTOOLS_KEY=""

# Hybrid Analysis
export HYBRIDANALYSIS_KEY=""

# Maxmind
export MAXMIND_ID=""
export MAXMIND_KEY=""

# MISP
export MISP_KEY=""
export MISP_URL=""

# RiskIQ
export RISKIQ_USERNAME=""
export RISKIQ_KEY=""

# Shodan
export SHODAN_KEY=""

# Twilio
export TWILIO_SID=""
export TWILIO_AUTH=""

# URLScan.io
export URLSCAN_KEY=""

# Virustotal
export VIRUSTOTAL_KEY=""
#+end_src

Once these are set you can generate the API functions necessary to query the above API sources. Currently these sit in your homedir but this will change shortly^tm

#+begin_src bash
python3 /$HUNTING_BASE/bin/generate_files.py
#+end_src

And finally add the following to your emacs config:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "/path/to/hunting-mode.el")
(load-file "~/helm-sources.el")
#+end_src
