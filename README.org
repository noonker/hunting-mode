#+TITLE: Hunting-Mode
* THIS IS A WIP - Nothing Here Works Yet.
If what you're looking at here looks interesting to you hit me up here or on Twitter @  @noonker_

* Overview
The problem with working with DFIR/Infrastructure Analysis/Threat hunting types of workflows is the different ways of visualizing the data and the need for both structured data but also not-cumbersome workflows. In all things there's a give and take.

So ideally I want:
 - Freeform notes that have an understanding of IoCs
 - The IoCs should be automatically enriched with configured datasets (is this IoC in VT? If so show some glyph next to it to let me know)
 - A way to pull in external APIs intelligence into my notes and maintain that linkage
 - Automatically maintain the time metadata of an IoC (first seen, last seen, update dates, and changes)
 - Maintain seperate investigations but be able to link the IoCs between investigations
 - Exportable in sharable formats (csv, stix/taxii)
 - Exportable in a roughly human readable form
 - Be able to visualize the IoCs as both a series of relationships between nodes and a timeseries graph and be able to filter on the graph

I think using org-roam with some enhanced features focused on IoCs and Pivoting will give me a lot of this.
